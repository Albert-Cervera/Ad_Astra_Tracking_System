# Orbit Web Debris Tracker (O.W.D.T.)

We developed a web application which is based on NASA's WorldWind which was modified in order for us to keep track and plot orbiting objects and stars. In particular, our system keeps track of satellites, rocket bodies and space debris in the main orbits of Earth. Moreover, one of the most important propositions of our project is the computation of a ‘Risk Value’, which is the predicted probability of collision following a Bayesian model. Furthermore, our app is open source and relies on open sourced data, which if successful, it’ll gain easy adoption for the community to use and maintain. Our proposal is relevant because the tracking-estimation system would enable a tool for early warning.
